## BS-RoFormer

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02612">Band Split Roformer</a>, SOTA Attention network for music source separation out of ByteDance AI Labs. They beat the previous first place by a large margin. The technique uses axial attention across frequency (hence multi-band) and time. They also have experiments to show that rotary positional encoding led to a huge improvement over learned absolute positions.

It also includes support for stereo training and outputting multiple stems.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install BS-RoFormer
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from bs_roformer import BSRoformer

model = BSRoformer(
    dim = 512,
    depth = 12,
    time_transformer_depth = 1,
    freq_transformer_depth = 1
)

x = torch.randn(2, 352800)
target = torch.randn(2, 352800)

loss = model(x, target = target)
loss.backward()

# after much training

out = model(x)
```

To use the Mel-Band Roformer proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01809">a recent follow up paper</a>, simply import `MelBandRoformer` instead

```python
import torch
from bs_roformer import MelBandRoformer

model = MelBandRoformer(
    dim = 32,
    depth = 1,
    time_transformer_depth = 1,
    freq_transformer_depth = 1
)

x = torch.randn(2, 352800)
target = torch.randn(2, 352800)

loss = model(x, target = target)
loss.backward()

# after much training

out = model(x)
```

## Todo

- [x] get the multiscale stft loss in there
- [x] figure out what `n_fft` should be
- [x] review band split + mask estimation modules
